# Network-Troubleshooting-Toolkit
This Python-based Network Troubleshooting Toolkit automates the collection of diagnostic data from multiple network devices simultaneously. It uses secure SSH connections, executes a list of "show" commands, and saves the output to timestamped files for easy analysis. It is designed for troubleshooting and does not perform configuration changes.
